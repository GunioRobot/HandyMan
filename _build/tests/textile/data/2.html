<p>[[$aboutme_image]] Hi! My name is Mark Hamstra, and I am a [[Age? &input=`05-11-1990`]] years old freelance web and mainly MODX Developer / Consultant from the Netherlands. I have spent two years studying International Hospitality Management at the Stenden University of Applied Sciences in Leeuwarden, however after the second year I decided to quit, and focus on developing my MODX Development company: Mark Hamstra Web Development.</p>
<p>Personally I find pleasure in helping people in a variety of ways, including creating a night out for guests in my former restaurant job, as well as actually seeing things happen, something that is very much present in developing websites and custom solutions. Combining those two, helping people make things happen, sounds like something I could do for a long time even though that is a very vague statement and could mean a lot.</p>
<p>My business revolves around, and is based on, the <a title="MODX, Content Framework" href="http://www.modx.com">MODX Content Framework</a> and in March 2011 I sealed that commitment by becoming a MODX Professional Solution Partner. I have seen MODX grow in the past years, and when I made the move to Revolution in December 2010, as well as starting to do more custom development, I have seen my company grow with roughly the same speed. I focus on developing addons/extras but enjoy the variety of integrating designs into MODX and providing remote (or on-site if near) training.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about MODX, or are still learning, I would love to get in touch.
