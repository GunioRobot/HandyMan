<h2>How MODx works</h2>
<p>MODx works for you, not the other way around. You build your mark-up (varying from a html table filled layout or standards compliant HTML5, to XML to use in your Flash application and everything in between) and tell MODx where to put user edited content using specific tags. MODx does not output anything (absolutely nothing!) unless you tell it to, so you have complete control over your website.</p>
<p>Let's go through the basics of MODx, and the terms used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first thing to mention are <strong>Resources</strong>. <a title="RTFM: MODX Resources" href="http://rtfm.modx.com/display/revolution20/Resources">Resources</a> represent pages (<em>in the broadest sense of the word</em>) within your site. Resources can be split into four different categories, in MODX terms the category is called the class key. They are:</p>
<ul><li><img src="/favicon.ico" alt="this be my favicon"/><br /><a href="#home"><strong>Documents</strong></a> best described as "pages". <br />Documents contain actual content which you will modify from the backend.</li>
<li><a title="RTFM: weblinks" href="[[~35]]"><strong>Weblinks</strong></a> asd: will redirect the viewer to the specified resource (for example a Document), or to a specified URL</li>
<li><a title="RTFM: static resource" href="http://rtfm.modx.com/display/revolution20/Static+Resource,+with+comma"><strong>Static resource</strong></a>, takes the content of a file on the fileserver.</li>
<li><a title="RTFM: symlink" href="http://rtfm.modx.com/display/revolution20/Symlink"><strong>Symlinks</strong></a> as: acts as a copy of another resource;</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use [[$chunkname]] chunk tags, [[!snippetname? &property=`value`]] snippets and [[+placeholders:ellipsis=`20`]] placeholders.</p>
